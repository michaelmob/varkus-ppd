<p>
	The file locker is a locker created specifically for the purpose of locking important files
	that you would otherwise not want to share without any sort of compensation.
	You can use the various options to customize how the user obtains
	your file.

	Example usage for this locker would be to upload homemade applications that
	you created. Another example is to upload your band's music that you would
	like to earn some revenue from. Basically, anything you think would be
	worth something.
