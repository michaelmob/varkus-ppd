<div class="ui header">Link Lockers</div>
<p>
	The link locker is a locker created specifically to lock links.
</p>

<p>
	Common usage for this locker would be to lock an uncommon link,
	that you would not like others to know for free.
</p>

<div class="ui header">Hide Your Link</div>
<p>
	Tick the "Proxy" checkbox on to hide your link from the unlocker.  Instead
	of being able to see the link after unlocking it, {% site_name %} will proxy
	the link to hide it.
</p>

<p>
	Be aware, however, that the static content (images, stylesheets, etc.) will be
	served from the original source and that only the original link will be hidden.
	{% site_name %} can only proxy up to 10Mb of content.
