<div class="ui header">List Lockers</div>
<p>
	The list locker is a locker created specifically to lock lists.
	You can use the various options to customize how the user obtains
	one of the items from the list.
</p>

<p>
	A list can be set so that its items are distributed: descending,
	ascending, or randomly. It can also be set to only output an item
	that was not previously distributed.
</p>

<p>
	Common usage for this locker would be to lock a list of serials or
	keys. For example, keys for your indie game that you want to give
	out for free but still want to make a profit off of.
