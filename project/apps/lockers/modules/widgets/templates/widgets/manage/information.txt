<div class="ui header">Widget Lockers</div>
<p>
	The widget locker is the most generic locker out of all of the Varkus
	lockers. It is dynamic and can be used for multiple purposes other than
	just a single, specific thing.

	More importantly, widgets are the only lockers that have the
	ability to send out an HTTP Notification when a conversion goes through.
